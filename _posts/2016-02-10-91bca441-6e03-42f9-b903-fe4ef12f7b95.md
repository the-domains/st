I am a full stack engineer at a growing company working across the stack and constantly pushing myself to learn. I have been working with JavaScript, Node.js, MongoDB, Redis, Jade, Stylus, Angular, React.js, Flux Architecture. I love going out of my comfort zone to work with new technologies and continue learning. I'm mainly focused on JavaScript and Node.js but I am open to learning new things. I also have been doing my own projects and I never stop playing around with any web development techniques. I'm looking to work in a company where I can grow and learn.
